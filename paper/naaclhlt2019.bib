@article{knowledgeDatabase,
	abstract = "In the past decade, the analysis of data has faced the challenge of dealing with very large and complex datasets and the real-time generation of data. Technologies to store and access these complex and large datasets are in place. However, robust and scalable analysis technologies are needed to extract meaningful information from these datasets. The research field of Information Visualization and Visual Data Analytics addresses this need. Information visualization and data mining are often used complementary to each other. Their common goal is the extraction of meaningful information from complex and possibly large data. However, though data mining focuses on the usage of silicon hardware, visualization techniques also aim to access the powerful image-processing capabilities of the human brain. This article highlights the research on data visualization and visual analytics techniques. Furthermore, we highlight existing visual analytics techniques, systems, and applications including a perspective on the field from the chemical process industry.

    abstract="The biomedical community makes extensive use of text mining technology. In the past several years, enormous progress has been made in developing tools and methods, and the community has been witness to some exciting developments. Although the state of the community is regularly reviewed, the sheer volume of work related to biomedical text mining and the rapid pace in which progress continues to be made make this a worthwhile, if not necessary, endeavor. This chapter provides a brief overview of the current state of text mining in the biomedical domain. Emphasis is placed on the resources and tools available to biomedical researchers and practitioners, as well as the major text mining tasks of interest to the community. These tasks include the recognition of explicit facts from biomedical literature, the discovery of previously unknown or implicit facts, document summarization, and question answering. For each topic, its basic challenges and methods are outlined and recent and influential work is reviewed.",
