The development set contains a total of 100 sentences manually annotated in [Brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/) and post-processed to match the input format.
These sentences are expected to be used to evaluate machine learning systems and tune their hyperparameters.
For actual training, 600 sentences are available in the [training set](../training/Readme.md).

To obtain the data, you can either manually download each file separately:

* [Development - raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019/master/data/development/input_develop.txt)
* [Development - output for Subtask A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019/master/data/development/output_a_develop.txt)
* [Development - output for Subtask B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019/master/data/development/output_b_develop.txt)

Or you can clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019.git
```

And visit the folder `data/development`.
