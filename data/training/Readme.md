The training set contains a total of 600 sentences manually annotated in [Brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/) and post-processed to match the input format.
These sentences are expected to be used for training machine learning systems.
An additional 100 sentences are available in the [development set](../development/Readme.md) for hyperparameter tunning.

To obtain the data, you can either manually download each file separately:

* [Training - raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019/master/data/training/input_training.txt)
* [Training - output for Subtask A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019/master/data/training/output_a_training.txt)
* [Training - output for Subtask B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019/master/data/training/output_b_training.txt)

Or you can clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/knowledge-learning/ehealthkd-2019.git
